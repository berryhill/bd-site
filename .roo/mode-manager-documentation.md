### Tarxan Workflow Agents

The Tarxan workflow consists of the following specialized agents working together in a strict sequence:

1. **Tarxan Orchestrator** (`tarxan-orchestrator`)
   - Coordinates the entire implementation workflow
   - Creates feature branches BEFORE any implementation work
   - Delegates specifically to `tarxan-implementation-agent` and `tarxan-documentation-agent` in sequence
   - Ensures each agent commits to the same feature branch
   - Provides specific web research instructions for `tarxan-implementation-agent`
   - Creates pull requests when all work is complete
   - NEVER writes code itself - strictly delegates implementation
   - NEVER reads the codebase itself - delegates that to specialized agents

2. **Tarxan Implementation Agent** (`tarxan-implementation-agent`)
   - Implements core functionality AND unit tests
   - MUST use web research for all resources before implementation
   - MUST ensure all unit tests pass before completing
   - Commits changes to the feature branch created by the orchestrator

3. **Tarxan Documentation Agent** (`tarxan-documentation-agent`)
   - Updates or creates documentation in the `docs` directory only
   - Commits documentation to the feature branch created by the orchestrator

### Workflow Process

1. `tarxan-orchestrator` receives issue and creates feature branch
2. `tarxan-implementation-agent` researches ALL resources via web and implements core functionality AND unit tests on that branch
3. `tarxan-documentation-agent` updates documentation on that branch
4. `tarxan-orchestrator` creates pull request from that branch to dev

All agents work on the same feature branch created by the `tarxan-orchestrator`, and each agent commits their changes to this branch. The workflow is strictly sequential, with each agent waiting for the previous one to complete before starting their work. The `tarxan-implementation-agent` must thoroughly research all resources using the web before beginning implementation and MUST ensure all unit tests pass before completing.

## Branch Management Rules

The following agents should NEVER switch branches or pull from dev:
- `tarxan-implementation-agent`
- `tarxan-documentation-agent`

Branch management is the EXCLUSIVE responsibility of the `tarxan-orchestrator` agent. The specialized agents should work on whatever branch they find themselves on and only commit their changes when their specific task is complete. The orchestrator handles all branch creation, switching, and management operations.

## Mode Updates - 2025-08-05 (Branch Management)

### Implementation, UnitTest, IntegrationTest, and Documentation Agents
- Added critical directive that these agents should NEVER switch branches or pull from main
- Clarified that branch management is the responsibility of the orchestrator agent

  - `.roo/rules-tarxan-delegator/02-tool-usage-guidelines.md`
- Each file contains agent-specific examples and guidelines
- Emphasized proper parameter usage for all tool functions

### Critical Tool Usage Rules
- ALWAYS provide a command parameter when using execute_command
- ALWAYS provide a path parameter when using file operation tools
- PREFER using MCP tools over direct command line operations when possible
- These changes address errors where Roo was attempting to use tools without providing required parameters
- Specifically fixes the issue with Tarxan-Orchestrator mode throwing an error when using execute_command without a command parameter
