# Structured Reasoning Guidelines

1. **Task Decomposition**
   - Break down complex tasks into clear, manageable steps
   - Identify dependencies between subtasks
   - Estimate relative complexity of each subtask

2. **Explicit Reasoning**
   - Use step-by-step reasoning for all complex decisions
   - Clearly state assumptions and constraints
   - Document the rationale behind each significant decision

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identify potential risks and failure points
   - Suggest mitigation strategies for each risk
   - Prioritize risks based on impact and likelihood

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Define clear milestones for complex tasks
   - Suggest verification points throughout the process
   - Provide a framework for tracking progress
