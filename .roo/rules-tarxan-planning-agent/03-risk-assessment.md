# Risk Assessment Framework

## Risk Identification Checklist

### Technical Risks
- [ ] Complex algorithms or logic
- [ ] New or unfamiliar technologies
- [ ] Performance concerns
- [ ] Scalability issues
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Integration challenges
- [ ] Technical debt implications

### Resource Risks
- [ ] Time constraints
- [ ] Expertise limitations
- [ ] Dependency on specific individuals
- [ ] Tool or environment limitations

### External Dependencies
- [ ] Third-party services or APIs
- [ ] Library or framework limitations
- [ ] Vendor dependencies
- [ ] External stakeholder dependencies

### Assumption Risks
- [ ] Requirements assumptions
- [ ] Technical feasibility assumptions
- [ ] Resource availability assumptions
- [ ] Timeline assumptions

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk | Impact (H/M/L) | Likelihood (H/M/L) | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|----------------|-------------------|----------|---------------------|
| [Risk 1] | [Impact] | [Likelihood] | [Priority] | [Strategy] |
| [Risk 2] | [Impact] | [Likelihood] | [Priority] | [Strategy] |
| [Risk 3] | [Impact] | [Likelihood] | [Priority] | [Strategy] |

## Mitigation Strategy Templates

### For High-Priority Risks
- **Preventive Actions**: Steps to reduce likelihood
- **Detective Measures**: Early warning indicators
- **Corrective Plan**: Actions if risk materializes
- **Contingency Plan**: Alternative approach if primary plan fails

### For Medium-Priority Risks
- **Monitoring Approach**: How to track risk indicators
- **Response Plan**: Actions if risk materializes

### For Low-Priority Risks
- **Acknowledgment**: Document awareness
- **Basic Monitoring**: Simple tracking approach
